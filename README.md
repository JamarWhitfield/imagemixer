## Image Mixer

This Python script generates synthetic images by adding random shapes to blank images. The purpose of this script is to create a dataset for testing computer vision algorithms or generating training data for machine learning models.

### How It Works

The script utilizes the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to create blank images and add shapes such as triangles, circles, and squares to them. Each shape is randomly positioned within the image, and its color is chosen randomly from a grayscale spectrum. The number of shapes added to each image is also randomized.

### Functionality

The script contains the following functionality:

- **add_shapes**: This function takes an image and adds a specified number of random shapes to it. Shapes can be triangles, circles, or squares, each filled with a randomly chosen grayscale color.

- **Main loop**: The main loop of the script iterates a specified number of times to create multiple synthetic images. For each iteration, a blank image is created, shapes are added to it using the `add_shapes` function, and the resulting image is saved with a unique filename.

### Usage

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required Python libraries by running:
   ```bash
   pip install Pillow numpy
   ```
3. Download the script (`img_processor.py`) to your local machine.
4. Customize the script as needed:
   - **Adjusting Resolution**: You can adjust the resolution of the output images by modifying the parameters passed to `Image.new('RGBA', (1920, 1080), (255, 255, 255, 255))`. Change the `(1920, 1080)` values to your desired width and height.
   - **Number of Images**: Change the number of images produced by modifying the range in the main loop. For example, to create 30 images, change `range(20)` to `range(30)`.
5. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python img_processor.py
   ```
6. Synthetic images will be generated and saved in the specified directory.

### Output

The script saves the generated images in PNG format with filenames in the format `output_{i}.png`, where `{i}` is a unique identifier for each image.

## Things to Add

Consider enhancing your Django project with the following features:

- **User Authentication and Authorization:**

  Implement user authentication and authorization to secure your application's resources and restrict access based on user roles and permissions. Utilize Django's built-in authentication and authorization functionalities for seamless integration.

- **Database Integration:**

  Integrate your Django project with a database to persistently store and manage data. Django supports various databases including SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and Oracle. Choose the one that best fits your project's requirements and configure database settings accordingly.

- **Static Files Management:**

  Set up Django to efficiently manage static files such as CSS, JavaScript, and images. Define static file directories using the `STATICFILES_DIRS` setting and specify the location for serving static files using the `STATIC_ROOT` setting.

- **Internationalization and Localization:**

  Support users from different regions or languages by adding internationalization and localization features to your application. Django provides built-in tools for translating text and formatting dates, numbers, and currencies.

- **Admin Panel Customization:**

  Customize the Django admin panel to provide a tailored interface for managing your application's data. Modify admin views, add custom actions, and customize admin forms to suit your project's specific requirements and preferences.

- **RESTful API Development:**

  Develop RESTful APIs using Django REST Framework to expose your application's functionalities as web APIs. This allows external clients to interact with your application programmatically, enabling seamless integration with other systems and services.

- **Frontend Framework Integration:**

  Integrate frontend frameworks such as React.js, Vue.js, or Angular.js with your Django project to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Use Django REST Framework to create a backend API and consume it in your frontend application for enhanced user experience.

- **Testing:**

  Ensure the correctness and reliability of your Django application by writing comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Leverage Django's built-in testing tools and utilities to facilitate testing and ensure robust application behavior.

- **Error Handling and Logging:**

  Implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to detect and handle errors gracefully. Utilize Django's logging framework to log errors, warnings, and other relevant information, ensuring smooth application operation and effective debugging.

- **Deployment:**

  Prepare your Django project for deployment to a production environment by configuring settings for security, performance, and scalability. Choose a suitable hosting platform and deploy your application using tools like Docker, Heroku, AWS, or DigitalOcean for seamless deployment and management.

- **Documentation and Code Comments:**

  Provide clear documentation and code comments to aid understanding and maintainability of your Django project. Document codebase with meaningful comments and docstrings, and create user documentation and guides to assist users in effectively using your application.

- **Performance Optimization:**

  Optimize your Django application for performance by identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks. Analyze and optimize database queries, cache frequently accessed data, and minimize response times for improved application responsiveness and user experience.
